Inventory System and Python Features Demo
Description

This project has two programs. The first one is an Inventory System, and the second one shows examples of some Python features like assert, lambda, del, raise, and yield.
Program 1: Inventory System

The Inventory System lets you manage items in a store or warehouse. You can:

    Add items.

    Remove items.

    Update item details.

    Show all items in inventory.

    Check if an item is in stock.

    Save the inventory to a file.

    Exit and move to the next program.

Program 2: Python Features Demo

This program shows how some Python features work:

    assert: Checks if a number is positive.

    lambda: A quick way to calculate the square of a number.

    raise: Creates errors on purpose to show how they work.

    yield: Generates numbers one by one.

    del: Deletes variables.

Keywords Used

Here are the keywords used in the programs:

    assert: Used to make sure inputs meet certain conditions (e.g., a number must be positive).

    del: Used to delete variables in the program.

    lambda: Used for quick, one-line functions.

    raise: Used to trigger an error when something goes wrong.

    yield: Used in generators to give values one at a time.

How to Use the Program
Inventory System

    Run the program.

    Choose an option from the menu.

    Follow the instructions (e.g., input item name, quantity, price).

    Save your inventory before exiting.

Python Features Demo

    Input a number to check if it’s positive (assert).

    Input another number to find its square (lambda).

    Choose to see an error or skip (raise).

    Input a limit to generate numbers (yield).

    See how deleting a variable works (del).

Notes

    The inventory is saved in a file called inventory.json. Make sure the file is in the same folder.

    If there’s no inventory file, the program will start fresh.

    Errors are handled, so the program won’t crash unexpectedly.
